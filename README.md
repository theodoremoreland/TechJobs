# Tech Jobs Persistent

This application is an evolution of previous Tech Jobs iterations whereby persistent storage is implemented into the application via
a MySQL DBMS, Spring Boot, and Hibernate ORM (hence Tech Jobs "Persistent"). The previous iteration [Tech Jobs MVC](https://github.com/theodoremoreland/TechJobsMVC),
introduced the Model View Controller Design pattern, which persists in the architecture of this iteration.

As with the other Tech Jobs applications ([Tech Jobs MVC](https://github.com/theodoremoreland/TechJobsMVC), [Tech Jobs Console](https://github.com/theodoremoreland/TechJobsConsole), and [Tech Jobs OOP](https://github.com/theodoremoreland/TechJobsOOP)),
this application allows users to search for, filter, and list job listings stored in the application's database (or RAM in the case of Tech Jobs OOP). Unique to this iteration,
the user can also create jobs via a web interface. Said job will then be indefinitely stored in a MySQL database.

Look below for images of the application in use.
